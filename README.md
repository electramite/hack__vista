This device uses a webcam to observe the world around the user (blind and colour blind) and make their lives

the colours are told to the user. Using this information, the user can decide which coloured clothes to wear, 
how their room looks and basically get an intuitive feel of how the world around them is.

This device uses a camera to observe the world around the user(blind and color blind) and make their lives better.
